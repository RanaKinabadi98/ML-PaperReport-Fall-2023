Chinese Digit Mnist Classifier

This repository contains a machine learning experiment for classifying Chinese digit characters using various classifiers and feature extraction methods. The code is implemented in Python and leverages popular libraries such as scikit-learn, gensim, CatBoost, TensorFlow, and Matplotlib.

Key Features:

Dataset: Chinese Digit Mnist dataset loaded from a CSV file.
Feature Extraction Methods:
Tf-Idf: Utilizes TfidfVectorizer for text data.
Word2Vec: Tokenizes and pads sequences, training a Word2Vec model for generating embeddings.
Classifiers:
CatBoost: Gradient boosting with categorical feature support.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Instance-based learning.
Decision Tree: Tree-based classification.
